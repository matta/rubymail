* Why RubyMail can't be completely transparent

    RubyMail parses the MIME message into a document structure.  If
    the MIME message is invalid, RubyMail might discard invalid
    portions, etc.  Also, if you parse and then serialize a
    RMail::Message, empty lines may be deleted or inserted around a
    MIME boundary.

    For these reasons, if you require a message to be output exactly
    as it is put in, I suggest that you do not filter it *through*
    RubyMail.  Instead, parse the message and decide what to do with
    it, and then save the original message.
