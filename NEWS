* Changes in RubyMail 0.9 (released 2002-11-30)

** New RMail::Mailbox.read_mbox method that can be used to conveniently
   read raw messages out of a Unix mbox mailbox.

** New RMail::Mailbox::MBoxReader class in
   rmail/mailbox/mboxreader.rb.  This class can be used to easily read
   messages out of a file in Unix "mbox" format.

** The RMail::Parser::PushbackReader class
   has been documented.  It has moved out of rmail/parser/multipart.rb
   into rmail/parser/pushbackreader.rb

** Various documentation fixes.  E.g. RMail::Parser.parse can take a
   string as well as an IO object.

** The RMail::Parser::PushbackReader has a setable chunk size.  This
   is useful mostly for testing.

** Fix an uncaught exception when parsing multipart MIME messages that
   contain only a preamble and an epilogue but no body parts.

** Fix a bug where RMail::Parser.multipart? would not return true if the
   multipart message actually didn't have any parts.

* Changes in RubyMail 0.8 (released 2002-03-18)

** The following has been removed from RubyMail and made part of the
   RubyFilter package:

 - All scripts that were in the RubyMail 0.7 bin directory.
 - Mail::LDA
 - Mail::Deliver
 - Mail::KeyedMailbox
 - Mail::MTA
 - Mail::AddressTagger

   This keeps RubyMail a small and simple mail package, and provides
   RubyFilter as an example of how to use RubyMail to write a mail
   filter.

** The Mail module has been renamed to RMail.  I think "Mail" should
   be reserved for things included in the standard distribution of
   Ruby.

**  RMail::Header#match and match? don't require the name or value
    arguments to be a case insensitive Regexps.  Also, when the value
    argument is converted to a string, it is passed through
    Regexp::escape first.

** RMail::Parser#parse can now parse from a string.

** Mail::Address#comments= can now take a simpple string to set just
   one comment.

* Changes in RubyMail 0.7 (released 2002-02-26)

** A new chunked input scheme that makes parsing huge messages about 7
   times faster in ruby 1.7 and 50 times faster in ruby 1.6.

   When parsing a huge message that has a 2 megabyte attachment,
   RubyMail running under ruby 1.7 is now faster than any email
   package for ruby, perl or python.

   I wrote a benchmark that reads a 2 megabyte email from a file and
   writes it out again, doing this 100 times.  The results are:

    ruby 1.7.2 w/rubymail (100 times)
         5.96s user  7.98s system 13.94s total
    ruby 1.6.6 w/rubymail (100 times)
        76.91s user  8.62s system 85.53s total
    ruby 1.7.2 w/tmail 0.10.1 (100 times)
         9.85s user 24.21s system 34.06s total
    ruby 1.6.6 w/tmail 0.10.0 (100 times)
        201.89s user 15.75s system 217.64s total
    python 2.2 w/email (100 times)
        76.73 user 15.16s system 91.89s total
    perl 5.006001 w/mimetools 5.411  (parsing on disk) (100 times)
        190.11s user 25.25s system 215.36s total
    perl 5.006001 w/mimetools 5.411  (parsing in memory) (100 times)
        962.69s user  6.77s system 969.46s total

  This change also paves the way for streaming large messages
  to disk when they start to get huge, so RAM isn't needlessly
  used up.

** Delivery to mbox files improved.

    - won't sleep forever waiting for the mailbox lock (flock)
    - won't delivery to files that don't look like an mbox
      (e.g. it is not a file, not in the right format).
    - delivering to '/dev/null' is now a simple nop.

** Use the new File#fsync method when available in all of the mail
   delivery functions.

** Add bin/rsendmail.rb as another example of how I'm using RubyMail.

** A new Mail::AddressTagger class, included for fun.  Requires the
   hmac-sha1 class (available in the ruby-hmac package on RAA).

* Changes in RubyMail 0.6 (released 2002-02-15)

** Multipart MIME support.

*** Mail::Parser now parses arbitrarily nested multipart MIME messages.

*** For the sake of dealing with multipart MIME messages, add the
    following methods to Mail::Message: preamble, epilogue, multipart?,
    add_part, decode, part.

** A new Mail::AddressTagger class, for tagging addresses with
   cryptographically verifiable extensions akin to TMDA.  Requires the
   hmac-sha1 module from the RAA.  (experimental, I don't currently
   use this)

** A new Mail::Message#== method.

** A new Mail::Serialize class that can serialize a Mail::Message.

* Changes in RubyMail 0.5 (released 2002-02-02)

** The rdeliver.rb script is now fully documented.

** The rdeliver.rb script now evaluates the .rdeliver file in the
   context of a Deliver class (as opposed to simply loading it).  The
   .rdeliver file must now define a Deliver#main method, where the
   simplest .rdeliver file would be:

    def main
      lda.save("INBOX")
    end

** Add a KeyedMailbox class that can be used to implement simple
   mailing list style confirmations.

** Add a message= method to Mail::DeliveryAgent.  This lets delivery
   scripts change the message being delivered.

** Re-wrote the RFC2822 address parser.  It is now more strict about
   what it considers a valid address.

* Changes in RubyMail 0.4 (released 2002-01-17)

** The bin/rdeliver.rb script is now tested.  Got rid of
   bin/rdeliver-wrap.rb.

** Mail::DeliveryAgent::DeliveryStatus renamed to
   Mail::DeliveryAgent::DeliveryComplete.
   Mail::DeliveryAgent::DeliverFailure renamed to
   Mail::DeliveryAgent::DeliveryPipeFailure.

** Mail::Deliver.deliver_mbox now uses File::SYNC to write the
   message.

** Mail::Header and Mail::Message no longer understand how to parse
   messages.  Message parsing has been moved to Mail::Parser.
   Mail::Parser uses the public API of Mail::Header and Mail::Message
   to build up the message.

** The Mail::Header API has been greatly changed.  It is now more like
   Array and Hash.

** Mail::Deliver supports delivery to qmail style Maildir mailboxes.
   Mail::DeliveryAgent#save will now deliver to a Maildir if the
   folder's name ends in a slash.  E.g. "/home/user/Maildir/".

** Mail::DeliveryAgent no longer logs an abstract of the message being
   delivered.  All logging is up to the users of Mail::DeliveryAgent.

* Changes in RubyMail 0.3

** Add Mail::Header.length and Mail::Header.size methods.  Add
   Mail::Header.match and Mail::Header.match? methods.

** Move deliver.rb to bin/rdeliver-wrap.rb and main.rb to
   bin/rdeliver.rb.  These are workable local delivery agent scripts
   (suitable for running from .forward).

** New Mail::MTA module that provides constants for exit codes.

** New features for Mail::DeliveryAgent.  Now Mail::DeliveryAgent
   never calls exit, instead it throws DeliveryStatus exceptions.
   There is also a new Mail::DeliveryAgent.process method that allows
   you to use Mail::DeliveryAgent in block form.
   Mail:DeliveryAgent.exitcode will return the correct exit code for a
   given DeliveryStatus exception.

* Changes in RubyMail 0.2

** HTML API documentation is now available in the doc subdirectory.

** Mail::DeliveryAgent::strip_tag is now
   Mail::DeliveryAgent::strip_field_name.

** Mail::Deliver::deliver_pipe implemented.  Mail::DeliveryAgent#pipe
   implemented.

** Mail::DeliveryAgent#pipe and Mail::DeliveryAgent#save now report
   success or failure with DeliverySuccess and DeliveryFailure
   exceptions.  Mail::DeliveryAgent#reject and
   Mail::DeliveryAgent#defer do not yet use the exceptions (they still
   call exit).

** Now runs clean under "ruby -w"

** Now works with newer rubyunit versions.
