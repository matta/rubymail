= Thanks to Python's email module for:

- The idea of separating parsing and serialization from the mail
  classes themselves.
- A lot of the MIME multipart API.

= Thanks to Perl's MimeTools for:

- Showing me this can all be done in the scripting language (no C
  extensions necessary).
- Accessing MIME parts via a File like API (thereby allowing them to
  be stored on disk).

= People:

"Yoshinori K. Okuji" <okuji-at-enbug-dot-org>

- Code to parse messages from strings (though since then I did it a
  much simpler way).
- Numerous other API suggestions and improvements.

- For prodding me to implement mbox mailbox parsing (and an initial
  implementation).  It took me months, but I did it!
