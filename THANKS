Thanks to Python's email module for:

    - The idea of separating parsing and serialization from the mail
      classes themselves.
    - A lot of the MIME multipart API.

Thanks to Perl's MimeTools for:

    - Showing me this can all be done in the scripting language (no C
      extensions necessary).
    - Accessing MIME parts via a File like API (thereby allowing them
      to be stored on disk).

    - Code to parse messages from strings.
    - Numerous other API suggestions and improvements.
