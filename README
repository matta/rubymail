What is RubyMail?

    This is RubyMail, a lightweight mail library containing various
    utility classes and modules that allow Ruby scripts to parse,
    modify, and generate MIME mail messages.

Status

    This package works well, but I consider all API subject to change.

    I very much appreciate suggestions and comments, but please think
    twice about using this for production use just yet.

Documentation

    See the doc/ subdirectory for HTML documentation.

Tests?

    This package has a complete unit test suite (requires RubyUnit to
    run).  Currently all of my e-mail is processed by this library.

Why?

    It is fun.

    One use for RubyMail is the RubyFilter package, available at:
