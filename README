What is RubyMail?

    This is RubyMail, a lightweight mail library containing various
    utility classes and modules that allow Ruby scripts to process
    email.

Status

    This package is currently very raw.  All API is subject to change.
    I very much appreciate suggestions and comments, but please think
    twice about using this for production use just yet.

Documentation

    See the doc/ subdirectory for HTML documentation.

Tests?

    This package has a complete unit test suite (requires RubyUnit to
    run).  Currently all of my e-mail is processed by this library.

Why?

    It is fun.

Why not use TMail?

    A much more mature mail library is available for Ruby -- TMail by
    Minero Aoki.  Please use it if you need a more stable API, or
    something with more features.

    TMail requires several C language Ruby extensions, while RubyMail
    is in pure Ruby.  Maybe this matters to you, maybe it doesn't.
