This is RubyMail, a lightweight mail library containing various
utility classes and modules that allow Ruby scripts to parse,
modify, and generate MIME mail messages.

= Requirements

Ruby 1.6.* or Ruby 1.8.*.  Only tested under Linux, should be fine
under any Unix.

= Documentation

The documentation is in RDoc format in the doc subdirectory.  Aside
from the API reference, you will be interested in guide/Intro.txt and
guide/TableOfContents.txt.

= Install

Type the following while in the package directory:

  ruby install.rb config
  ruby install.rb setup
  ruby install.rb install

You may need special permissions to execute the last line.  If you
want to just install RubyMail to a custom location, just copy the
rmail subdirectory manually.

= Status

This package works well, but I consider all API subject to change.

I very much appreciate suggestions and comments, but please think
twice about using this for production use just yet.

= Tests?

This package has a complete unit test suite (requires RubyUnit to
run).  Currently all of my e-mail is processed by this library.

= Why?

It is fun.

One use for RubyMail is the RubyFilter package, available at:
